# Introduction
In 2014 and 2015, the Maine Board of Pesticides Control collected sediment
samples from the Coast of Maine and Casco Bay, and analyzed them for presence of
selected pesticides, especially certain pyrethroid pesticides.

The only pyrethroid that was observed consistently was bifenthrin, probably
because bifenthrin could be detected in sediment samples at substantially lower
concentrations than the other pyrethroid pesticides on the testing panel.
 
We focus our analysis on bifenthrin.  Our principal goal is to produce a MAP of
average bifenthrin concentrations and a FIGURE showing the relationship between
bifenthrin concentration and extent of nearby impervious surfaces (as a rough
measure of urbanization).

```{r concentration_data}
conc_data <- read.delim(file.path(sibling, conc_fn), skip = 1) %>%

```

# Import IC metrics into conc_data
We calculate estimated organic-carbon weighted concentrations AFTER
calculating maximum likelihood estimates of dry weight.  Detection limits for
the relevant methods apply to dry weight concentrations, so that is the
appropriate place to calculate the ML estimators.

```{r add_IC_metrics and ml}
ml_estimator_Raw <- sub_cmeans(conc_data$Bifenthrin_Raw,
                                               conc_data$Bifenthrin_ND)
conc_data <- conc_data %>%
  mutate(pct500   = ic_data$pctI500[match(LocCode, ic_data$Location)],
         pct1000  = ic_data$pctI1000[match(LocCode, ic_data$Location)],
         pct2000  = ic_data$pctI2000[match(LocCode, ic_data$Location)]) %>%
  mutate(Bifenthrin_ML = ml_estimator_Raw,     # Raw observation (dry weight)
         Bifenthrin_OC_QML = Bifenthrin_ML * 100* (100/(100-Moisture)) / TOC) %>%
  mutate(across(starts_with('pct'), ~ round(.x * 100, 1)))
```


##  Log-linear Model
Although we have previously noted correlations with moisture and sand in
the sediment samples, we don't see either of those turning up as significant in 
a model that includes imperviousness.

```{r lm}
the_lm <- lm(log10(Bifenthrin_ML)~pct500 * Sand * Moisture, data = conc_data)
step_lm <- step(the_lm)
summary(step_lm)
```

So moisture is  meaningful predictor, but it is colinear with sand, 
confounding a simple linear model.  The interaction is not significant.
It is interesting that the coefficient with moisture in POSITIVE, meaning
sediments containing more moisture tend to hold more bifenthrin.

## Robust Regression
Because of the non-detects and possible outliers. we do not trust the linear
model al lthat much, so we compare results briefly with a robust linear model
based on M estimators. (M estimators downweight "outliers" in a systematic way, 
making the regression less sensitive to data that falls far away from the 
regression line).  

Limited exploration of other model structures suggest sand is sometimes a 
valuable predictor in a robust model setting when interactions between Sand
and Moisture are included.  But that complicates interpretation, for little
explanatory gain.  We stick with models without interaction terms.

```{r rob_reg}
the_lmrob <- lmrob(log10(Bifenthrin_ML)~pct500 + Sand + Moisture, data = conc_data)
summary(the_lmrob)
```

So, in a robust setting, moisture remains an effective predictor, and the
model does a considerably better job of predicting the data.

In practice, however, we want to show the relationship between impervious 
surfaces and bifenthrin. We can show that most 


## Theil-Sen Resistent Regression
We use a simpler resistant regression estimator, known as the Theil-Sen 
estimator (Actually a modification due to Seigal), implemented (*inter alia*) as
`mblm()` in the mblm package. This regression method can only handle a single
predictor, which in this case if the degree of nearby imperviousness.

Statistical significance for these tests can be a bit finicky in the case of
tied values, which we have here, so we resort to testing significance of the
closely related Kendall's Tau correlation coefficient. In a more careful
analysis, we might try permutation tests, or a bootstrap, but in this case, the
results are highly significant by any test, so there is little point in being
more precise.

Unfortunately, the mblm package does not handle missing values or data
transformations all that well, so we need to clean things up a bit.

```{r mblm}
tmp <- conc_data %>%
  filter(! is.na(pct500)) %>%
  select(pct500, Bifenthrin_ND, Bifenthrin_ML, Bifenthrin_OC_QML, Sand, Moisture) %>%
  mutate(log_bifenthrin  = log(Bifenthrin_ML),
         log_bifenthrin_oc = log(Bifenthrin_OC_QML))

```

```{r}
the_mblm <- mblm(log_bifenthrin~pct500, data = tmp)
summary(the_mblm)
cor.test(tmp$pct500,tmp$log_bifenthrin, method = 'kendall')
```

We create a dataframe to pass to ggplot to generate the regression line in 
our plot.

```{r prepare_graphic}
coefs <- coef(the_mblm)
theline <- tibble(x = seq(0,42.5, .25),
                  y = exp(coefs[[1]] + coefs[[2]]*seq(0,42.5, .25)))
```

### Showing the Resistant Regression
```{r resistant_regression_plot}
plt <- ggplot(tmp, aes(pct500, Bifenthrin_ML)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Bifenthrin_ND), size = 3) +
  geom_line(data = theline, aes(x,y),
            color = cbep_colors()[5],
            lwd = 1) +
  geom_text(aes(x=4, y=0.55, label = 'Yarmouth 2014'),
            hjust = 0, size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(x=42.5, y=0.99, label = 'South Portland 2014'),
            hjust = 1, size = 3) +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(legend.position=c(0.75, 0.2)) +
  
  scale_color_manual(values = cbep_colors()[c(1,3)], name = '',
                     labels = c('Observed', ' Estimated\n(Below Detection Limit)')) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  
  ylab('Bifenthrin (ng/g)') +
  xlab('Percent Impervious w/in 500 m')
plt
```

# Concentrations on an Organic Carbon Basis
Toxicity of organic contaminants in sediment are often more highly correlated
concentrations as a fraction of the organic carbon in the sample, rather than 
the mass fraction in the entire sample.  Maine BEP toxicologist, Pam Breyer,
used OC-based concentrations to evaluate whether levels of bifenthrin approached
levels of concern, and concluded that they did not.

In our context, looking at spatial patterns, rather than toxicity, it is not
obvious which concentration basis makes better sense.  Here we produce the
OC-based graphic, for completeness, although we are unlikely to use it in the 
Report.

## Log-Linear Model
```{r lm_oc}
the_lm <- lm(log10(Bifenthrin_OC)~pct500 * Sand * Moisture, data = conc_data)
step_lm <- step(the_lm)
summary(step_lm)
```

Sand, Moisture and a Sand by Moisture interaction are retained by AIC, but are
not statistically significant in the final model.


## Robust Regresison
```{r rob_reg_oc}
the_lmrob <- lmrob(log10(Bifenthrin_OC)~pct500 + Sand + Moisture, data = conc_data)
summary(the_lmrob)
```
As for the linear model, only the impervious cover term is statsitically 
significant.

## Theil-Sel (Seigal) Estimator
```{r mblm2}
the_mblm <- mblm(log_bifenthrin_oc~pct500, data = tmp)
summary(the_mblm)
cor.test(tmp$pct500,tmp$log_bifenthrin_oc, method = 'kendall')
```

### Showing the Resistant Regression
We again create a dataframe.
```{r prepare_graphic_2}
coefs <- coef(the_mblm)
theline <- tibble(x = seq(0,42.5, .25),
                  y = exp(coefs[[1]] + coefs[[2]]*seq(0,42.5, .25)))
```

```{r plot_3}
plt <- ggplot(conc_data, aes(pct500, Bifenthrin_OC_QML)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Bifenthrin_ND), size = 3) +
  geom_line(data = theline, aes(x,y),
            color = cbep_colors()[5],
            lwd = 1) +
  geom_text(aes(x=0, y=65, label = 'Yarmouth 2014'),
            hjust = 0, size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(x=40, y=95, label = 'South Portland 2014'),
            hjust = 1, size = 3) +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(legend.position=c(0.75, 0.2)) +
  
  scale_color_manual(values = cbep_colors()[c(1,3)], name = '',
                     labels = c('Observed', ' Estimated\n(Below Detection Limit)')) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  
  ylab('Bifenthrin (ng/g OC)') +
  xlab('Percent Impervious w/in 500 m')
plt
```
