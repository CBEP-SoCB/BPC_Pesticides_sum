Analysis of data from 2014 and 2015 Maine Board of Pesticides Control marine 
sediment and water sampling for selected pesticides.

# Statement of Purpose
CBEP is committed to the ideal of open science.  Our State of the Bay data
archives ensure the science underlying the 2020 State of the Bay report is
documented and reproducible by others. The purpose of these archives is to
release raw data and data analysis code whenever possible to allow others to
review, critique, learn from, and build upon CBEP science.

# Archive Structure
 CBEP 2020 State of the Bay data analysis repositories are divided into from two
 to four sub-folders.  All archives contain at least an "Original_Data" and a
 "Graphics" folder.  The other two folders are only included if strictly
 necessary.

- Original Data.  Original data, with a "DATA_SOURCES.md" or "READ ME.txt" file
that documents data sources.  
    **DATA IN THIS FOLDER IS AS ORIGINALLY PROVIDED OR ACCESSED.** 

- Derived Data.  Data derived from the original raw data.  Includes
documentation of data reorganization steps, either in the form of files (R
notebooks, Excel files, etc.) that embody data transformations, or via another
README.txt file. - Analysis.  Contains one or more R Notebooks proceeding
through the data analysis steps. - Graphics.  Contains R Notebooks stepping
through development of related graphics, and also raw copies of resulting
graphics, usually in \*.png and \*.pdf formats.  These graphics may differ from
graphics as they appear in final State of the Bay graphical layouts.

# Summary of Data Sources
Maine Board of Pesticides Control staff collected sediment samples along the 
Coast of Maine in 2014 and 2015.

## Sediment Sampling
BPC Staff conducted intertidal sediment sampling at 20 locations along the Coast
of Maine in 2014. In 2015 Samples were collected specifically in Casco Bay.  The
sampling locations in 2015 included heavily populated shorelines as well as
shorelines of unpopulated islands. Sedient samples were analyzed for a limited
number of pesticides and pesticide constituents, principally pyrethroids.

## Stormwater Sampling
BPC staff and volunteers collected stormwater samples along the coast of Maine
(at sites close to where the intertidal sediment samples were collected in 2014)
in August of 2015.  All water samples were collected within 24 hours of each
other, allowing for the timing of the storm as it took a southwest to northeast
path across the coastal sampling area. Samples were analyzed for a larger group
of pesticides and pesticide residues.
